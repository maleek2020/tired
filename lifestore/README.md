a) Create a Product mode
I don't understand what is meant by that


b) Create a command to migrate the products data above into the database
I have done this in command.py and i explained it there.

c) Create a GraphQL endpoint to return all the products to the FE 
I have done that in schema.py but i have an issue which am trying to debug (it returning only the last product), if more time is give i will complete it sir/ma. My lateness is due to my health issue but i'm fine now.

d) Encapsulate your back-end services in docker containers
Have not done it yet, if more time is given it will be done sir/ma. THANK YOU.
