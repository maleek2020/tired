a) Create a products page to show the GraphQL fetched products in cards with appropriate product data(name, price, pictures, etc.)
Since my Graphql is not ready i made a static data at src/data.js and it fecting everything correctly


b) Each product should have an "Add to cart" button
The add to cart button is added to the card at src/components/card.js

c) On click add to cart, show cart summary component as an overlay and add the product to the cart
It is done at src/components/cart.js, when you click on the cart at the top right coner it takes you there, and when you click lifestore health it takes you back to cards

d) Allow increment(+), decrement(-) and delete functionality on each cart item in the cart
It is done at src/components/cart.js


I will share the link on how to view it at github.

My lateness is because i was sick but am fine now.

I will be glad if more time is given so i will get the API ready and use Graphql to fetch it to the FE.
